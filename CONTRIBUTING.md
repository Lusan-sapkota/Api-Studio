### Development Setup

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Api-Studio.git`
3. Set up the backend:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
4. Set up the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```
5. Run the development servers:
   ```bash
   # Backend (in one terminal)
   cd backend && uvicorn main:app --reload

   # Frontend (in another terminal)
   cd frontend && npm run dev
   ```

### Making Changes

1. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
2. Make your changes following our coding standards
3. Write tests for new functionality
4. Ensure all tests pass: `pytest` (backend) and `npm test` (frontend)
5. Update documentation as needed

### Coding Standards

- **Backend (Python):**
  - Follow PEP 8 style guide
  - Use type hints
  - Write docstrings for functions and classes
  - Keep functions small and focused
